Loading the Data into Jupyter Using a Pandas DataFrame
Data is stored in tables, which means it can be saved as a comma-separated variable (CSV) file.
This format, and many others, can be read into Python as a DataFrame object, using the Pandas library. 
we ndeed, Pandas has support for all of these.
